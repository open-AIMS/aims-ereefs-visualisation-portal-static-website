## Source data

The videos/images on this page are based on the [4km eReefs Hydrodynamic model
(v2.0)](https://research.csiro.au/ereefs/models/) of the Great Barrier Reef.
The raw data is available from the [NCI THREDDS
server](https://dapds00.nci.org.au/thredds/catalog/fx3/gbr4_v2/catalog.html) (hourly) and the aggregate data from the [AIMS eReefs THREDDS
server](https://thredds.ereefs.aims.gov.au/thredds/catalog/catalog.html)
(daily, monthly, yearly, all). These map layers are also available for
inspection as an [interactive
map](https://maps.eatlas.org.au/atlasmapper/client/ereefs/index.html).
