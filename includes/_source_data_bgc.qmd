## Source data

The videos/images on this page are based on the [4km eReefs BioGeoChemical model (v3.1) (GBR4_H2p0_B3p1_Cq3b_Dhnd)](https://research.csiro.au/ereefs/models/) 
run with SOURCE Catchments using Baseline catchment conditions. Detailed information about the model can be found 
in the paper: [CSIRO Environmental Modelling Suite (EMS): Scientific description of the optical and biogeochemical 
models (vB3p0)](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2019-115). The raw model data is available from the [NCI THREDDS server](https://thredds.nci.org.au/thredds/catalog/fx3/gbr4_bgc_GBR4_H2p0_B3p1_Cq3b_Dhnd/catalog.html) (daily, in curvilinear NetCDF format) 
and the aggregate data from the [AIMS eReefs THREDDS server](https://thredds.ereefs.aims.gov.au/thredds/s3catalogue/aims-ereefs-public-prod/derived/ncaggregate/ereefs/GBR4_H2p0_B3p1_Cq3b_Dhnd/catalog.html?_gl=1*140ovqw*_ga*MTg3NjQyODQyNS4xNjk1MTY5ODcw*_ga_6SSTNBNHXG*MTY5NTc3MDQwNC4xMy4xLjE2OTU3NzA4MzEuMC4wLjA.) (daily, monthly, yearly, in in regular rectangular 
grid NetCDF format).
