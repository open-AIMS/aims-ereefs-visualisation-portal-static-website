Model variables
---------------

### Total suspended solids (EFI)

This is the sum of the suspended sediments in the water column. It is
\[Fine sediment\] + \[Mud\] + \[Mud carbonate\] + \[Mud mineral\] +
\[Dust\]. Total suspended solids is measured in mg/l and the variable representing it is EFI - Ecology Fine Inorganics.

### Total suspended solids pre-industrial minus baseline (EFI_pre-base)

This variable represents the difference of total suspended solids in mg/l between the pre-industrial 
scenario and the baseline scenario. This highlights the anthropogenic impact.

EFI_pre-base = pre-industrial (q3p) EFI - baseline (q3b) EFI 

### Total suspended solids reduced loads (WQIP-Targets) minus baseline (EFI_reduced-base)

This variable represents the difference total suspended solids in mg/l between the reduced loads 
(WQIP-Targets) scenario and the baseline scenario. This highlights the alignment of the current state with the targets.

EFI_reduced-base = reduced loads (q3R) EFI - baseline (q3b) EFI
