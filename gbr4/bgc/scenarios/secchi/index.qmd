Model variables
---------------

### Secchi depth (Secchi)

Secchi depth is an estimate of water clarity, which is traditionally
measured by lowering a [secchi disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secchi_disk) into the water until
the disk can not be seen. The model estimates the optical properties of
the water based on the sediment and nutrients in the water. These all
affect the scattering and absorption of light as it passes through the
water allowing the model to estimate the attenuation of the light
through the water. The Secchi depth is calculated from the vertical
integral of attenuation of light at 488nm.

### Secchi depth pre-industrial minus baseline (Secchi_pre-base)

This variable represents the difference of Secchi depths in meter between the pre-industrial 
scenario and the baseline scenario. This highlights the anthropogenic impact.

Secchi_pre-base = pre-industrial (q3p) Secchi - baseline (q3b) Secchi 

### Secchi depth reduced loads (WQIP-Targets) minus baseline (Secchi_reduced-base)

This variable represents the difference Secchi depths in meter between the reduced loads 
(WQIP-Targets) scenario and the baseline scenario. This highlights the alignment of the current state with the targets.

Secchi_reduced-base = reduced loads (q3R) Secchi - baseline (q3b) Secchi
