Model variables
---------------

### Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN)

Concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN). DIN = \[NH~4~\] +
\[NO~3~\].

Within the GBR lagoon the main source of DIN is from land run off during
flooding events. These flood plumes generally stay close to the
coast, pushed northwards by the wind. The nitrogen in the plumes leads
to rapid growth of phytoplankton. This algal rich water absorbs light
leading to less light reaching the seagrass meadows and inshore coral
reefs (see [Secchi depth, vertical attenuation at 490nm & light
intensity above seagrass product](../../baseline/secchi_kd-490_epipar-sg))
lowering their growth.

#### Model specifics

This visualisation shows the modelled concentration of dissolved
inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in mg N m-3. DIN is the sum of nitrate and
ammonium concentrations, \[NO3\]+\[NH4\].

The model contains two forms of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) used
by photosynthetic organisms, dissolved ammonium (NH4) and dissolved
nitrate (NO3). In the model, the ammonium component of the DIN pool is
taken up first, followed by the nitrate, with the caveat that the uptake
of ammonium is limited by diffusion.

For nitrogen the main sources are river inputs, the atmosphere by
nitrogen fixing Trichodesmium cyanobacteria and from upwelling of deeper
nutrient rich waters. Nitrogen fixation (conversion of nitrogen gas to
ammonium) occurs by trichodesmium algae when DIN is low (4 to 20 mg N
m−3; Robson et al., 2013) and carbon and phosphorus are available to
support nitrogen uptake.

An assessment of the BGC model shows it has a skill of (bias ± Root Mean
Square Error) of nitrate of −0.70±3.86 mg N m−3 and ammonium of
−0.77±1.63 mg N m−3 (Baird e. al., 2020). This represents the difference
between the model values and 36 long-term water quality monitoring sites
along the Queensland coast.

### Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen pre-industrial minus baseline (DIN_pre-base)

This variable represents the difference in concentration of dissolved
inorganic nitrogen in mg N m-3 between the pre-industrial scenario and the 
baseline scenario. This highlights the anthropogenic contribution.

DIN_pre-base = pre-industrial (q3p) DIN - baseline (q3b) DIN 

### Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen reduced loads (WQIP-Targets) minus baseline (DIN_reduced-base)

This variable represents the difference in concentration of dissolved
inorganic nitrogen in mg N m-3 between the reduced loads (WQIP-Targets) scenario and the
baseline scenario. This highlights the alignment of the current state with the targets.

DIN_reduced-base = reduced loads (q3R) DIN - baseline (q3b) DIN
