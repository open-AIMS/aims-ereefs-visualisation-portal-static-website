Model variables
---------------

### Light intensity above seagrass (EpiPAR_sg)

The variable EpiPAR_sg represents the light intensity above seagrass
measured in daily light integral (mol photons per square meter per day).
Please note that the eReefs BGC model is using a 4km resolution and is
developed for large-scale predictions. 

### Light intensity above seagrass pre-industrial minus baseline (EpiPAR_sg_pre-base)

This variable represents the difference of daily light intensity above seagrass in mol photons per square meter between 
the pre-industrial scenario and the baseline scenario. This highlights the anthropogenic impact.

EpiPAR_sg_pre-base = pre-industrial (q3p) EpiPAR_sg - baseline (q3b) EpiPAR_sg 

### Light intensity above seagrass reduced loads (WQIP-Targets) minus baseline (EpiPAR_sg_reduced-base)

This variable represents the difference of daily light intensity above seagrass in mol photons per square meter between 
the reduced loads (WQIP-Targets) scenario and the baseline scenario. This highlights the alignment of the current state 
with the targets.

EpiPAR_sg_reduced-base = reduced loads (q3R) EpiPAR_sg - baseline (q3b) EpiPAR_sg
