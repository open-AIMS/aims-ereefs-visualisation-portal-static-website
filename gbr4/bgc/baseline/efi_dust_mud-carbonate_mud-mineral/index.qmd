The sediment is modelled in multiple layers with a thin layer of easily
resuspendable material overlying thicker layers of more consolidated
sediment. The sediment model contains inorganic particles of different
size (Dust, Mud, Sand and Gravel) and different mineralogies (carbonate
and non-carbonate). The critical shear stress for resuspension, and the
sinking rates, are generally larger for large particles, while and
mineralogy only affects the optical properties. The size-class Dust
comes only in a non-carbonate mineralogy, and the Mud-carbonate class
contains a category of FineSed-mineral that has the same physical and
optical properties as Mud-mineral, except that it is initialised with a
zero value and only enters the domain from rivers.

Total Suspended Solids
----------------------

This is the sum of the suspended sediments in the water column. It is
\[Fine sediment\] + \[Mud\] + \[Mud carbonate\] + \[Mud mineral\] +
\[Dust\]. Suspended sediment is often measured in mg / L. To convert
between the model units (kg / m^3^) and typical units (mg / L), multiply
the values by 1000, so 0.005 kg / m^3^ = 5 mg / L.

Dust
----

Very fine terrestrial sediment (nominal size 1 µm) released from the
catchments via the rivers. It has a sinking velocity of 1 m d^-1^. This
fine particle size is intended to model fine particles that are
distributed in flood plumes.

Mud carbonate
-------------

Small sized (nominal size 30 µm), re-suspending particles with a sinking
velocity of 17 m d^-1^. This sediment is white in colour.

Mud mineral
-----------

Small sized (nominal size 30 µm), re-suspending particles with a sinking
velocity of 17 m d^-1^. This sediment is brown in colour.
