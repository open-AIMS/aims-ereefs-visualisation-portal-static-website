Carbon chemistry background
---------------------------

Coral reefs are constructed from calcium carbonate (CaCO~3~) produced by
hard corals and other calcifying organisms. Coral polyps form this
calcium carbonate by combining calcium (Ca^2+^) and carbonate
(CO~3~^2-^) ions in the seawater. This is achieved by the corals
trapping small amounts of seawater, containing calcium ions (Ca^2+^), in
small vesicles (small capsules) at the surface of the coral tissue.
These vesicles slowly migrate through the coral tissue to its skeleton.
On the way carbonate ions (CO~3~^2-^) are then injected into these
vesicles from the coral tissue, raising its concentration above
surrounding seawater levels, helping to accelerate the carbonate
precipitation (solid crystal formation). The biological process used to
pump in the carbonate ions is not yet well understood. In the vesicles
an amorphous (unstructured) calcium carbonate forms. Once the vesicles
reach the surface of the skeleton the amorphous calcium carbonate
particles attach to the skeleton and slowly transform into
**aragonite**, which is the crystal structure of calcium carbonate that
makes up the bulk of the coral skeleton (Mass et al., 2017).

The total **Dissolved Inorganic Carbon** (DIC) in seawater is made up
from the sum of dissolved carbon dioxide (CO~2(aq)~), bicarbonate ions
(HCO~3~^-^) and carbonate ions (CO~3~^2-^). The distribution of these
carbon molecule species varies with the seawater pH. At a typical
seawater pH of 8.1, bicarbonate dominates, representing around 90% of
DIC. Carbonate ions (CO~3~^2-^) are the next most abundant species
(\~10% of DIC), while carbon dioxide CO~2(aq)~ represents less than 1%
(Barker and Ridgwell, 2012). Increases in atmospheric CO~2~ results in
more dissolved CO~2~ combining with water (H~2~O) to form carbonic acid
(H~2~CO~3~). This lowers the **pH** of the water as the carbonic acid
molecule splits into hydrogen ions (H^+^) and bicarbonate ions
(HCO~3~^-^). It is the free hydrogen ions (H^+^) that make it acidic.
The existing carbonate ions (CO~3~^2-^) in the water buffer the pH by
combining with the extra hydrogen ions (H^+^) to form bicarbonate
(HCO~3~^-^). As a result, increasing CO~2~ levels lowers the seawater
pH, which in turn lowers the amount of carbonate in the seawater, which
can impede calcification. While the CSIRO eReefs BioGeoChemical (BCG)
model assumes a constant atmospheric CO~2~ level (and as such doesn\'t
model increasing CO~2~ levels) understanding this causal change is
useful to understanding how **pH** and **total alkalinity**
(HCO~3~^-^+CO~3~^2-^) are related.

Surface seawater is generally supersaturated with respect to calcium
carbonate minerals, meaning that the concentration of calcium and
carbonate ions is higher than the concentration needed for precipitation
to occur. The **aragonite saturation state** is commonly used to track
ocean acidification because it is a measure of carbonate ion
concentration. Aragonite is one of the more soluble forms of calcium
carbonate (CaCO~3~) and is widely used by marine calcifiers to build
their skeletons and shells. Corals and other calcifiers are more likely
to survive and reproduce when the saturation state is greater than
three. When aragonite saturation state falls below 3, these organisms
become stressed, and when saturation state is less than 1, shells and
other aragonite structures begin to dissolve (NOAA, n.d.).

### What do these visualisations show?

These maps show estimates, based on the eReefs BioGeoChemical model, of
key variables that relate to ocean acidity and a metric (aragonite
saturation state) that measures how easy it is for calcium carbonate
(which makes up shells and coral skeletons) to precipitate (solidify) or
dissolve.

In these visualisations we can see that the pH goes through a seasonal
cycle with a lower pH in summer due to higher temperatures. The pH and
aragonite saturation state is often lower near the coast. This is most
likely due to plankton growth, which removes DIC from the water as it is
converted to biological forms of carbon. This lowers the DIC, which in
turn lowers the aragonite saturation state and pH.

### Limitations

The version of the BGC model here assumes a constant value for
atmospheric CO~2~ of 396.4 ppm, see page 101 of Baird (2019). It is
therefore not suitable for looking at trends in changes due to ocean
acidification.

Model variables
---------------

### Total alkalinity

Concentration of ions that can be converted to uncharged species by a
strong acid. The model assumes total alkalinity is the sum of the
bicarbonate and carbonate ions (A~T~ =\[HCO~3~^-^\] + \[CO~3~^2-^\]),
often referred to as carbonate alkalinity. Alkalinity and DIC together
quantify the equilibrium state of the seawater carbon chemistry.

### PH

pH based on \[H^+^\] calculated from carbon chemistry equilibra at water
column values of temperature (T), salinity (S), dissolved inorganic
carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (A~T)~.

### Aragonite saturation state

The aragonite saturation state of seawater is the product of the
concentrations of dissolved calcium and carbonate ions in seawater
divided by their product at equilibrium: ( \[Ca^2+^\] Ã— \[CO~3~^2-^\] )
/ \[CaCO~3~\], where dissolved calcium \[Ca^2+^\] is the seawater
concentration of dissolved calcium ions, \[CO~3~^2-^\] is the seawater
concentration of carbonate ions and \[CaCO~3~\] is the solubility of
aragonite in seawater. When the aragonite saturation state is 1, the
seawater is exactly in equilibrium or saturation with respect to
aragonite and as a result aragonite does not dissolve or precipitate.

In the BGC model coral growth is halted for aragonite saturation state
values less than 2. The aragonite saturation state value determines the
coral calcification rate in the model, where calcification is
proportional to the amount that the aragonite saturation state value is
above 1 and the carbon reserves of the coral.
