A key challenge with validating the BGC model is that the number of in-situ
observations is very limited compared with the geographic scope and detail of
the model. To help overcome this limitation the CSIRO eReefs BGC model
simulates the light transport through the water based on the nutrients,
plankton and suspended sediments. It uses this information to simulate what the
ocean would look like if it were imaged by the NASA MODIS satellite. This
allows the model results to be directly compared with satellite imagery to
check its performance and skill.

This visualisation shows the estimated colour image as would be seen by the
MODIS satellite, except with no clouds. While we don't create a direct
comparison with the MODIS imagery here on this site, you can view the MODIS
imagery via the [NASA WorldView browser](https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/?v=128.54593584758447,-31.75702092134829,171.2501420451839,-8.125135981270493&l=Reference_Labels(hidden),Reference_Features(hidden),Coastlines,MODIS_Aqua_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor(hidden),MODIS_Terra_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor).
