These visualisations show the amount of modelled seagrass and macroalgae
represented as the amount of nitrogen contained in their biomass in each
modelled pixel. Seagrass and macroalgae play a key role in the nitrogen
cycle of inshore areas. When they grow they take up nitrogen, phosphorus
and carbon from the water into their leaf and root structures. When they
die they break down and release these nutrient stores back into the
water column.

Seagrasses are represented in the model as an amount per m^2^ with a
constant stoichiometry (C:N:P = 550:30:1) for both above-ground, and
belowground, biomass, and can translocate organic matter at this
constant stoichiometry between the two stores of biomass. Growth occurs
only in the above-ground biomass, but losses (grazing, decay etc.) occur
in both. Multiple seagrass varieties are represented. The varieties are
modelled using the same equations for growth, respiration and mortality,
but with different parameter values.

The model parameters for each of the three types of seagrass are shown
in Table 24 (pg 48) of [Baird et al.
(2019)](http://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2019-115).

Details about about the macroalgae model are detailed in section 4.2 of
[Baird et al. (2019)](http://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2019-115).

### Limitations

These maps show model derived estimates of density for seagrass and
macroalgae. They are not derived from direct observations. Observed
seagrass distributions can be found from the dataset: [Seagrass mapping
synthesis: A resource for coastal management in the Great Barrier Reef
(NESP TWQ Project 3.2.1 and 5.4, TropWATER, James Cook
University)](https://eatlas.org.au/data/uuid/5011393e-0db7-46ce-a8ee-f331fcf83a88).

The BGC model assumes that morality of macroalgae has a constant rate (see
section 4.2.4 of [Baird et al. (2019)](http://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2019-115)) and so macroalgae dynamics are not
affected by environmental factors such as cyclones.

Macroalgae N
------------

Concentration of nitrogen biomass per m^2^ of macroalgae. Macroalgae (or
seaweed) grows above all other benthic plants (corals, seagrasses,
benthic microalgae). It is parameterised as a non-calcifying leafy
algae, with a C:N:P ratio of 550:30:1, and a formulation for calculating
the percentage of the bottom covered as 1-exp(-Î©~MA~ MA). In the model,
in the absence of both calcifying macroalgae (particularly Halimeda) and
unicellular epiphytes, macroalgae represents the biomass of all seaweeds
and epiphytes. Light is accessed in the following order: Macroalgae,
Seagrass, Coral.

Seagrass Zostera N
------------------

Concentration of nitrogen biomass per m^2^ of a seagrass form
parameterised to be similar to Zostera. This form captures light after
it has passed through macroalgae and before it passes through Halophila.
This form is better adapted to high light, low nutrient conditions than
Halophila as a result of a deeper root structure and being able to shade
it. See macroalgae for elemental ratio and bottom cover. Light is
accessed in the following order: Macroalgae, Seagrass, Coral.

Seagrass Halophila N
--------------------

Concentration of nitrogen biomass per m^2^ of a seagrass form
parameterised to be similar to Halophila. This form captures light after
it has passed through the Zostera seagrass form. The Halophila form is
better adapted to low light conditions than Zostera, having a faster
growth rate and lower minimum light requirement. See macroalgae for
elemental ratio and bottom cover. Light is accessed in the following
order: Macroalgae, Seagrass, Coral.

Deep seagrass N
---------------

Concentration of nitrogen biomass per m^2^ of a seagrass form
parameterised to be similar to Halophila deciphens. This form captures
light after it has passed through the Zostera and Halophila ovalis
seagrass form.
