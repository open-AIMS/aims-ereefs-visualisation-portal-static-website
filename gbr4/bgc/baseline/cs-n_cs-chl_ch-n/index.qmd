### What do these visualisations show?

These visualisations show model results of the uptake of nitrogen by
corals, showing how much is contained in the coral tissue (coral host
nitrogen) and how much is contained in the symbiotic zooxanthellae algae
that grow inside the coral (coral symbiont).

These maps show that the coral nutrient and chlorophyll levels change
very slowly over time. The main effect that can been seen in these
visualisations is that the corals increase their chlorophyll density
(and its corresponding nitrogen levels) during the winter months when
the light levels are lower.

### Limitations

These visualisations show some of the internal dynamics of the coral
modelling performed in the BGC. This model uses a \'single polyp\' model
that estimates the nutrient dynamics created by the coral in each grid
cell of the model. This coral model helps the BGC to capture the
nutrient dynamics caused by the uptake and release of nitrogen of corals
as they grow and the effect they have on the PH of the water as they
calcify their skeletons.

The BGC coral model and these matching visualisations should only be
used as a guide for better understanding the BGC model and not as a
reflection of the state of coral on the GBR. The BGC model does not
include a detailed coral ecosystem model and thus does not provide an
estimate of coral cover. It does not consider the effects of coral
mortality caused by cyclones, disease or Crown-of-Thorns Starfish and so
only provides a first approximation to how the coral reefs affect water
chemistry.

This coral model is limited to coral reef areas (as determined by the
GBRMPA reef features dataset), which is why there are only non-zero
values over coral reef pixels. Additionally the model does not consider
coral reefs in Torres Strait as these reefs were not included in the
GBRMPA reef features dataset used to configure the model.

**Note:** The visualisations for the monthly and yearly aggregations are
based on regridded data (converting the original raw model data from a
curvilinear grid to a regular rectangular grid). This process uses
interpolation to perform the regridding process. Since this data is very
discontinuous (zero everywhere, except for coral reef pixels) this
interpolation results in visual anomalies around the boundaries of the
reefs as the interpolation smooths the transition from the coral reef
pixels to zero for open water.

Coral symbiont N
----------------

Concentration of nitrogen biomass per m^2^ of coral symbiont cells, or
zooxanthellae. C:N:P is 106:16:1. Light is accessed in the following
order: Macroalgae, Seagrass, Coral.

Coral symbiont Chl
------------------

Concentration of chlorophyll biomass per m^2^ of coral symbiont cells.
As chlorophyll is the only pigment resolved in the coral symbiont, ci
represents the sum of the concentration of all photosynthetic pigments
within the cell and has an absorption spectrum of divinyl chlorophyll a.
Light is accessed in the following order: Macroalgae, Seagrass, Coral.

Coral host N
------------

Concentration of nitrogen biomass per m^2^ of coral host tissue in the
entire grid cell. Unlike other epibenthic variables, corals area is
assumed to exist in communities that are potentially smaller than the
grid size. The fraction of the grid cell covered by corals is given by
A~CH~. Thus the biomass in the occupied region is given by CH/A~CH~. The
percent coverage of the coral of the bottom for the whole cell is given
by A~CH~ (1 - exp(-Î©~CH~ CH/A~CH~)). With only one type of coral
resolved, CH represents the biomass of all symbiotic corals. Since the
model contains no other benthic filter-feeders, CH best represent the
sum of the biomass of all symbiotic filter-feeding organisms such as
corals, sponges, clams etc. C:N:P is 106:16:1. Light is accessed in the
following order: Macroalgae, Seagrass, Coral.
