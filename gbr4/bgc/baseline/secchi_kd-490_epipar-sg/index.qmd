Secchi depth
------------

Secchi depth is an estimate of water clarity, which is traditionally
measured by lowering a [secchi
disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secchi_disk) into the water until
the disk can not be seen. The model estimates the optical properties of
the water based on the sediment and nutrients in the water. These all
affect the scattering and absorption of light as it passes through the
water allowing the model to estimate the attenuation of the light
through the water. The Secchi depth is calculated from the vertical
integral of attenuation of light at 488nm.

Vertical attenuation at 490nm
-----------------------------

As light passes through the water column its intensity descreases due to
a combination of absorption and scattering. The amount of light
descreases exponentially as a function of the depth. The amount of light
at a given depth can be estimated by scaling the surface irradiance by
*e*^*(-Kd\*depth*)^, where Kd is the vertical attenuation coefficient,
and *e* is the base of the natural logarithm.

In practice the vertical attenuation varies with the wavelength of light
as colours are absorbed at different rates due to the inherent
properties of sea water (blue penetrates more than red light) and the
amount of sediment and organic material in the water. The vertical
attenuation also varies with depth if the water column is not fully
mixed. Stratification of colour dissolved organic matter (CDOM) or
suspended sediment can result in variation in the clarity of the water,
and thus the vertical attenuation, with depth.

In the BGC model the vertical attenuation is a depth dependent variable
that corresponds to the light attenutation in the model depth layer at a
wavelength of 490 nm (blue/cyan). It is calculated based on the optical
model of the water, which considers the wavelength dependent absorption
and scattering of the light through the water column depending on the
amount of modelled colour dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and sediment
in the water column. Further details of the vertical attenuation is
outlined in section 3.2.2 of the [BGC Appendix B: Scientific description
of the optical, carbon chemistry and biogeochemical
models](https://research.csiro.au/ereefs/?ddownload=651).

Light intensity above seagrass
------------------------------

The variable EpiPAR\_sg represents the light intensity above seagrass
measured in daily light integral (mol photons per square meter per day).
Please note that the eReefs BGC model is using a 4km resolution and is
developed for large-scale predictions. This limits the possibility of
using this variable for a detailed analysis of processes relevant to
seagrass. The [NESP project
3.2.1](https://nesptropical.edu.au/index.php/round-3-projects/project-3-2-1/)
(*Deriving ecologically relevant load targets to meet desired ecosystem
condition for the Great Barrier Reef: a case study for seagrass meadows
in the Burdekin region*) is currently investigating the possibility of
using this model to derive and test ecologically relevant targets.
