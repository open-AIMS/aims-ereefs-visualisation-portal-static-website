# About AIMS eReefs platform

The eReefs research project is a collaboration between the [Great
Barrier Reef Foundation](https://www.barrierreef.org/),
[CSIRO](https://www.csiro.au/), the [Australian Institute of Marine
Science](https://www.aims.gov.au/), [Bureau of
Meteorology](http://www.bom.gov.au/), and [Queensland
Government](https://www.qld.gov.au/). It aims to develop a platform that
will provide a picture of what is currently happening on the reef and
what has happened in the past. This website provides visualisations and
aggregations of the eReefs hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models
allowing easy access to the current and historic environmental
conditions on the Great Barrier Reef.

About the eReefs models
-----------------------

The [eReefs hydrodynamic model](https://research.csiro.au/ereefs/models/models-about/models-hydrodynamics/)
predicts the movement of marine waters, as well as key physical
environmental conditions such as water temperature and salinity. This
model is a deterministic physics based model that evolves based on
equations of conversation of momentum, continuity and conservation of
heat and salt driven externally by wind, atmospheric pressure gradients,
surface heat and water fluxes and open-boundary conditions such as tides
and low frequency ocean currents. The external boundary of CSIRO
hydrodynamic model are forced by the [BOM Access-R weather models](http://www.bom.gov.au/australia/charts/about/about_access.shtml)
and [BOM OMAP for boundary currents](http://www.bom.gov.au/oceanography/forecasts/). The GBR1 1 km
model is nested inside the GBR4 4 km model, with the GBR4 acting as the
boundary of the GBR1 model.

The hydrodynamic model results allow us to better understand the effect
of cyclones, the location of potentially damaging heat waves that can
cause coral bleaching, the ocean currents that disperse larve of corals
and Crown-of-Thorns starfish, and fresh water plumes from flooded rivers
that can damage inshore reefs.

The [eReefs BioGeoChemical (BGC) and sediment model](https://research.csiro.au/ereefs/models/models-about/models-biogeochemistry/)
uses the results of the hydrodynamic model to track the movement and
concentration of nutrients and sediments. It models the effects of land
run off into the marine space and the nutrient recycling processes
associated with plankton, seagrass and coral.

What does this website show?
----------------------------

This site presents visualisations of key variables from both the eReefs
Hydrodynamic and BGC models. The raw model outputs are available
publicly via the [National Computing Infrastructure (NCI) THREDDS data
service](https://dapds00.nci.org.au/thredds/catalogs/fx3/catalog.html)
and are described in more detail on the [Access to raw model output](https://research.csiro.au/ereefs/models/model-outputs/access-to-raw-model-output/)
page on the CSIRO eReefs site. The problem is that using the raw model
data directly can be a huge challenge due to their huge data size (\~ 19
TB). The raw model data uses files that have a curvilinear grid, that
helps the efficiency of the model, but prevents the data from being
directly viewable in GIS applications such as QGIS or ArcGIS. Another
significant challenge is that the model data has over 10\'s of millions
of individual map layers making it very difficult to understand the
processes looking at them one at a time. The AIMS eReefs platform aims
to solve these problems by:

-   Presenting visualisations using pre-rendered videos. These videos
    provide rapid viewing of the eReefs data. These videos show multiple
    related variables, to allow the connections between key processes to
    be easily seen,
-   Generating aggregations over time (daily, months, seasonal, annual)
    of the model data to show longer time scale spatial patterns of
    variables, whilst shrinking the data to a more manageable size,
-   Regridding the model data from curvilinear data to a rectangular
    grid so that it can be used in a desktop GIS applications,
-   Providing a [data extraction service](https://extraction.ereefs.aims.gov.au/) that allows time
    series data of locations of interest to be easily downloaded,
-   Providing [data services](https://thredds.ereefs.aims.gov.au/thredds/catalog/catalog.html)
    of all the generated derived data so that it can be accessed
    programmatically to facilitate reproducible science.
-   Generating exposures maps to identify regions where organisms are
    being exposed to harsh conditions that might adversely affect their
    health.

The products on this website are updated in near real time from the NCI
data services. As CSIRO updates the model data this site regenerates and
updates the visualisation and data services available.

How are the map products on this website generated?
---------------------------------------------------

Two new tools were developed to process and visualise the eReefs model
data. These were a tool for processing the model outputs to calculate
time aggregates and exposures (Ncaggregate), and a tool for
automatically generating maps and videos from the data (Ncanimate).
Along with these tools a host of smaller coordinating tools were
developed. These were to automate the mirroring of data, to coordinate
the processing workflow and for presenting of the thousands of products
on the website.

The GBR4 and GBR1 model data is generated by CSIRO. It is then push to
the National Computing Intrastructure (NCI) where it is made available
publicly as a data service. The AIMS eReefs platform creates a local
partial mirror of the data, stripping off unused variables to save on
space. This data is then processed to produce regridded aggregation data
with daily, monthly and annual aggregations. This data is made available
as data services to allow data download, programmatic access to the data
and as a web mapping service to link in with the CSIRO eReefs Vis
Portal. The raw model data, along with the aggregated data is visualised
as maps and map videos. These are made available via the AIMSeReefs
visualisation portal. The final component is the data extraction tool.
Requests from users triggerÂ the extraction process. These extractions
can take a while and so users are emailed back when there extractions
are complete.

How do I access the data used in the visualisations?
----------------------------------------------------

All the dataset used to create the visualisations on this site are made
available in NetCDF format from our **[AIMS eAtlas THREDDS
server](https://thredds.ereefs.aims.gov.au/)**.

These correspond to all the aggregate products generated by this
project. This corresponds to daily, monthly, annual aggregates. These
files have been regridded to a regular grid to allow them to be loaded
into a standard GIS application such as ArcMap. You can do this by
following the [Reading netCDF as a raster layer](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/netcdf/reading-netcdf-data-as-a-raster-layer.htm) guide.

How do I access the data programmatically?
------------------------------------------

All the data used in the visualisations are available programmatically
via the **[AIMS eAtlas THREDDS server](https://thredds.ereefs.aims.gov.au/)** by either download the
full NetCDF data or by using libraries to access the data using the
OPeNDAP data protocol. The following are tutorials in using these
services in a range of languages.
