For the visualisations on these pages the AIMS eReefs system aggregates
the raw eReefs data and creates new
[NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) files (see also
ArcGIS [What is netCDF
data?](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/netcdf/what-is-netcdf-data.htm)).
These files can be downloaded from the [AIMS eReefs THREDDS
server](https://thredds.ereefs.aims.gov.au/) (for more information on
how to download the files see the tutorial [How to manually download
derived data from
THREDDS](../how-to-manually-download-aims-ereefs-data/index.qmd)).
Once downloaded, the files can be visualised and analysed using common
GIS tools like [ArcMap](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/) and
[QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/).

**Note:** This tutorial refers only to the NetCDF files produced by the
AIMS eReefs system ([AIMS eReefs derived
data](https://thredds.ereefs.aims.gov.au/)) and not the raw eReefs data
produced by CSIRO ([available on the NCI THREDDS
server](https://dapds00.nci.org.au/thredds/catalogs/fx3/catalog.html)).
This is due to the usage of a curvilinear grid in the raw eReefs data
which is better suited to the modelling and execution requirements than
a rectilinear grid. However curvilinear grids are incompatible with many
off-the-shelf GIS software packages (including ArcMap and QGIS) and can
be cumbersome to process with typical data science tools. Therefore, all
eReefs derived datasets generated by the AIMS eReefs system have been
regridded to a rectilinear grid.

Open a derived NetCDF file with ArcMap
--------------------------------------

For this step-by-step tutorial ArcMap version 10.6.1 was used.

ArcMap provides good tutorials about handling NetCDF files on their
[website](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/netcdf/about-the-netcdf-tutorial.htm).
This step-by-step description follows the tutorial [Displaying a raster
layer from a netCDF
file](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/netcdf/exercise-1-displaying-a-raster-layer-from-a-netcdf-file.htm).

1.  Download the file of interest (see [How to manually download derived
    data from
    THREDDS](../how-to-manually-download-aims-ereefs-data/index.qmd)
    for more information).
2.  Start ArcMap.
3.  Select the tool \"Make NetCDF Raster Layer\" by either using the
    \"Search\" or expanding the branch \"Multidimension Tools\" in the
    \"ArcToolbox\".

<br>![Open NetCDF file with ArcMap - screenshot 1](./open-netcdf-file-with-arcmap-screenshot1-1000x679.png)

4.  In the popup window
    1.  For the input field \"Input netCDF File\" select the NetCDF file
        downloaded in step 1.
    2.  Click the Variable drop-down arrow and choose a variable from
        the list.
    3.  Leave the default values for \"X Dimension\" and \"Y
        Dimension\".
    4.  Enter a layer name in the input field \"Output Raster Layer\".
    5.  Optionally, to create a multiband raster, click the Band
        Dimension drop-down arrow and choose a dimension from the list.
    6.  Leave the optional input \"Dimension values\" blank, this will
        be adjusted in the next step.
    7.  Click \"OK\" to start the processing.
        
    <br>![Open NetCDF file with ArcMap - screenshot 2](./open-netcdf-file-with-arcmap-screenshot2.png)
        
5.  Once the layer is processed and shown in the \"Layers\" tab,
    double-click on the layer to open the \"Properties\" window
    1.  Select the \"NetCDF\" tab at the top of the window.
    2.  In the \"Dimension Values\" field
        1.  Select a value for the time.
        2.  And select a value for the depth (dimension \"k\").\
            Here is an overview of the values for this dimension
            depending on the selected model:
              
              | **Index (k)**   | **Hydrodynamic 1km model** | **Hydrodynamic and BioGeoChemical 4km model** |

              : *Mapping of dimension k to depth value in meters*{.hover}
              
    3.  Click \"OK\" to close the property window and apply the
        changes.

Open a derived NetCDF file with QGIS
------------------------------------

For this step-by-step tutorial QGIS version 3.14.1-Pi was used.

1.  Download the file of interest (see [How to manually download derived
    data from
    THREDDS](../how-to-manually-download-aims-ereefs-data/index.qmd)
    for more information).
2.  Start QGIS.
3.  In the top menu select \"Layer\" -\> \"Add Layer\" -\> \"Add Raster
    Layer\".
    
<br>![Open NetCDF file with QGIS - screenshot 1](./open-netcdf-file-with-qgis-screenshot1.png)
    
4.  In the popup window (\"Data Source Manager\")
    1.  As \"Source type\" select \"File\".
    2.  In the \"Source\" input field select the NetCDF file downloaded
        in step 1.
    3.  Click the \"Add\" button.

    <br>![Open NetCDF file with QGIS - screenshot 2](./open-netcdf-file-with-qgis-screenshot2.png)

    4.  Another popup window opens. Select one or more variables and
        click \"OK\".

    <br>![Open NetCDF file with QGIS - screenshot 3](./open-netcdf-file-with-qgis-screenshot3.png)

    5.  Close the \"Data Source Manager\" window by clicking the
        \"Close\" button.
5.  By default QGIS uses a multiband symbology. To adjust this and
    select the time and depth, double click on the layer and select the
    \"Symbology\" tab on the left.
    1.  For a single band rendering, switch the \"Render type\" to
        either \"Singleband gray\" or \"Singleband pseudocolor\". For
        the remainder of this description we will use \"Singleband
        pseudocolor\".
    2.  Select a \"Band\". Each band is a combination of time and
        depths. Unfortunately, QGIS displays the time values as \"days
        since 1990-01-01\", but you can use an online tool like
        [timeanddate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/date/dateadded.html?d1=01&m1=01&y1=1990&type=add&ay=&am=&aw=&ad=1&rec=)
        to calculate the date.
    3.  Click the \"Apply\" button to trigger a recalculation of the
        \"Min\" and \"Max\" values.
    4.  Optionally, after the \"Min\" and \"Max\" values have changed
        you can click the \"Classify\" button to re-classify the label
        values.
    5.  Click \"OK\" to close the property window.
