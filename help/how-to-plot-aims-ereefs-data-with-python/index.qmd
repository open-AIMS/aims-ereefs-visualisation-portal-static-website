We have a dedicated page for eReefs tutorials relate to R and Python. See [https://open-aims.github.io/ereefs-tutorials/](https://open-aims.github.io/ereefs-tutorials/) for more information.

The [Basic access to the AIMS eReefs Server with Python](https://open-aims.github.io/ereefs-tutorials/tutorials/python/access-ereefs-data-server/basic-server-access/basic_server_access_python.html) tutorial is most relevant to plotting data with Python.
