How to access the AIMS eReefs data using OPeNDAP and ArcMap
===========================================================

OPeNDAP stands for \"Open-source Project for a Network Data Access
Protocol\" (see <https://www.opendap.org/about>) and can be used to
access remote NetCDF files. The [AIMS eReefs THREDDS
server](https://thredds.ereefs.aims.gov.au/) provides access via OPeNDAP
for all NetCDF files produced by the AIMS eReefs system. In this
tutorial we will use [ArcMap](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/) to
render the data, but you can also have a look at our tutorials [How to
plot AIMS eReefs data with
R](../how-to-plot-aims-ereefs-data-with-r/index.qmd) and [How to
plot AIMS eReefs data with
Python](../how-to-plot-aims-ereefs-data-with-python/index.qmd) for
a more programatically approach. More clients can be found on the
[OPeNDAP clients](https://www.opendap.org/support/OPeNDAP-clients)
website.

**Should I download the NetCDF files or use OPeNDAP to access the
data?**

The answer to this question depends mainly on the use-case. In general,
the use of OPeNDAP is slower and more un-responsive but it is a good way
to explore the data before downloading it (NetCDF files can be very
large, sometimes multiple GB). When you exactly know which file(s) you
need, it is recommended to download the file(s) (see [How to open a
NetCDF file with ArcMap and
QGIS](../how-to-open-a-NetCDF-file-with-ArcMap-and-QGIS/index.qmd))
as this will make working with the file(s) faster.

Finding the OPeNDAP URL
-----------------------

1.  Open the [AIMS eReefs THREDDS server
    website](https://thredds.ereefs.aims.gov.au/) and select the link
    [Data derived from the eReefs
    model](https://thredds.ereefs.aims.gov.au/thredds/catalog/catalog.html).
2.  On the next page select the link to the required model
    1.  [GBR4\_H2p0\_B3p1\_Cq3P\_Dhnd](https://thredds.ereefs.aims.gov.au/thredds/catalog/ereefs/GBR4_H2p0_B3p1_Cq3P_Dhnd.html)
        := eReefs BioGeoChemical model version 3.1 (4 km resolution) -
        source catchments using **Pre-Industrial** catchment conditions
    2.  [GBR4\_H2p0\_B3p1\_Cq3R\_Dhnd](https://thredds.ereefs.aims.gov.au/thredds/catalog/ereefs/GBR4_H2p0_B3p1_Cq3R_Dhnd.html)
        := eReefs BioGeoChemical model version 3.1 (4 km resolution) -
        source catchments using **Hindcast** catchment conditions
        (anthropogenic loads reduced according to the percentage
        reductions of DIN, PN, PP and TSS specified in the [Reef 2050
        Water Quality Improvement Plan
        2017-2022](https://www.reefplan.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/46115/reef-2050-water-quality-improvement-plan-2017-22.pdf))
    3.  [GBR4\_H2p0\_B3p1\_Cq3b\_Dhnd](https://thredds.ereefs.aims.gov.au/thredds/catalog/ereefs/GBR4_H2p0_B3p1_Cq3b_Dhnd.html)
        := eReefs BioGeoChemical model version 3.1 (4 km resolution) -
        source catchments using **Baseline** catchment conditions.
    4.  [gbr1\_2.0](https://thredds.ereefs.aims.gov.au/thredds/catalog/ereefs/gbr1_2-0.html)
        := eReefs Hydrodynamic model version 2.0 (1 km resolution)
    5.  [gbr4\_v2](https://thredds.ereefs.aims.gov.au/thredds/catalog/ereefs/gbr4_v2.html)
        := eReefs Hydrodynamic model version 2.0 (4 km resolution)
3.  Each model has its derived output grouped into folders with the
    names indicating the time steps and aggregation in a file. For
    example a folder with the name\"daily-monthly\" contains \"monthly\"
    files with \"daily\" data while a folder with the name
    \"annual-annual\" contains \"annual\" files with \"annual\" data.
    Select the link to the folder of interest.
4.  In the list of NetCDF files, select the one of interest. The file
    names describe the data they contain with the structure
    \"EREEFS\_organisations\_model\_timestep-aggregation-date.nc\". For
    example the file
    \"EREEFS\_AIMS-CSIRO\_gbr4\_v2\_hydro\_daily-monthly-2010-09.nc\"
    can be broken down into:\
    \"AIMS-CSIRO\" := Reference to the organisations AIMS and CSIRO\
    \"gbr4\_v2\_hydro\" := eReefs Hydrodynamic model version 2.0 (4 km
    resolution)\
    \"daily\" := \"daily\" data\
    \"monthly\" := one month of data\
    \"2010-09\" := data for September 2010
5.  On the single file page in the section \"Access\" click the link
    \"OPENDAP\"
6.  On the next page copy the value of the input field \"Data URL\".
    This is the URL for opening the file in a GIS tool.

Access the data with ArcMap
---------------------------

For this step-by-step tutorial ArcMap version 10.6.1 was used.

1.  Start ArcMap.
2.  Select the tool \"Make OPeNDAP Raster Layer\" by either using the
    \"Search\" or expanding the branch \"Multidimension Tools\" in the
    \"ArcToolbox\".
3.  In the popup window
    1.  For the input field \"Input OPeNDAP URL\" paste the URL copied
        in the previous section (\"Finding the OPeNDAP URL\").
    2.  Click the Variable drop-down arrow and choose a variable from
        the list.
    3.  Leave the default values for \"X Dimension\" and \"Y
        Dimension\".
    4.  Enter a layer name in the input field \"Output Raster Layer\".
    5.  Optionally, adjust the \"Extent\" values
    6.  Optionally, to create a multiband raster, click the Band
        Dimension drop-down arrow and choose a dimension from the list.
    7.  Enter \"time\" in the \"Dimension Values (optional)\" field and
        click the \"+\" (plus) button on the right side.
    8.  The dimension \"time\" should have been added to the list below
        the field. Now select a \"Start Value\" and a \"End Value\" by
        clicking on the field in the list.
    9.  Enter \"k\" in the \"Dimension Values (optional)\" field and
        click the \"+\" (plus) button on the right side. The dimension
        \"k\" represents the depths dimension.
    10. The dimension \"k\" should have been added to the list below the
        field. Now select a \"Start Value\" and a \"End Value\" by
        clicking on the field in the list.\
        Here is an overview of the values for this dimension depending
        on the selected model:
