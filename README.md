# eReefs Static Website

## Setup

- Install Quarto
- run `quarto preview` and confirm the website displays as expected.

## Previewing

To see a preview of the site, run `quarto preview`, or alternatively render the markdown to html with `quarto render` then run `python3 -m http.server`

## Publishing

### Publishing manually

- Check out the branch you wish to deploy (ensure you have not checked out the `gh-pages` branch).
- run `quarto publish gh-pages`

This command will render the content, copy the output to the `gh-pages` branch, push that branch to GitHub.

### Publishing with GitHub Actions

Publishing with GitHub Actions set up according to [the quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages#github-action). However, the `_publish.yml` file was not generated by `quarto publish gh-pages`, which is not consistent with the documentation. The `.github/workflows/publish.yml` file has been set up to run the Quarto Publish on commits to the `main` branch. To publish with GitHub actions, push your changes to the `main` branch.

There has been some weird behaviour with the background image in the header. This may only work when published manually (at least initially).

## Styling

Several eReefs websites exist, which are linked to in the drop down menu of this website. This website has been styled with the [Flatly](https://bootswatch.com/flatly/) theme, modified to align with the CSIRO website as it is likely the one most difficult to change.

## Custom navigation

In order to match the styling of the CSIRO website, cusom navigation was created. This was done because quarto supports only a pinned header, or 

... maybe I can build the nav bar as normal, but use javascript to change the navbar-nav class.
