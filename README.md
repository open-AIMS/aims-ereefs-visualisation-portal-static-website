# eReefs Static Website

## Setup

- Install Quarto
- run `quarto preview` and confirm the website displays as expected.

## Previewing

To see a preview of the site, run `quarto preview`, or alternatively render the markdown to html with `quarto render` then run `python3 -m http.server`

## Publishing

### Publishing manually

- Check out the branch you wish to deploy (ensure you have not checked out the `gh-pages` branch).
- run `quarto publish gh-pages`

This command will render the content, copy the output to the `gh-pages` branch, push that branch to GitHub.

### Publishing with GitHub Actions

Publishing with GitHub Actions set up according to [the quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages#github-action). However, the `_publish.yml` file was not generated by `quarto publish gh-pages`, which is not consistent with the documentation. The `.github/workflows/publish.yml` file has been set up to run the Quarto Publish on commits to the `main` branch. To publish with GitHub actions, push your changes to the `main` branch.

There has been some weird behaviour with the background image in the header. This may only work when published manually (at least initially).

## Styling

Several eReefs websites exist, which are linked to in the drop down menu of this website. This website has been styled with the [Flatly](https://bootswatch.com/flatly/) theme, modified to align with the CSIRO website as it is likely the one most difficult to change.

## Custom navigation

In order to match the styling of the CSIRO website, cusom navigation was created. This was done because quarto supports only a pinned header, or a dynamically hidden header with headroom.js. In order to create this custom header: 

- create the header with the _quarto.yml file
- rendered the page
- copy the code for the header
- put this code into the custom include (`includes/_navbar_custom.qmd`)
- change the header id="quarto-header" to id="custom-header"

When the website is built quarto will create it's own header, which is why we have the `javascript/remove_quarto_header.js` file to remove it.


# TODO items after first round feedback

- [ ] any video:
  - [x] `Time step:` tabs
    - [x] space between icon and text
      - [x] remove underline the `Time step:` tabs
        - [x] vertical-align: middle is causing this or something similar
    - [x] sort monthly tab wrapping on small screen
  - [ ] video size is not responsive and not full screen
    - [ ] Should I do this? We don't want to video to be so small that it's unusable on mobile. You want people to be able to scroll and hit the full screen button
  - [ ] remove debuging logs
  - [ ] consistent css between Download buttons
  - [ ] Elevation drop down value is not remembered when switching timesteps
  - [ ] Calendar year:
    - [ ] no year in calendar
    - [ ] calendar year navigation needs some thought. Help section exists in order to explain the navigation problem around years (clicking the arrows doesn't actually change the year).
    - [ ] consider implementing a drop down
  - [ ] make it obvious which months in calendar are links and which have no data.
- [x] footer
  - [x] add links to all logos
  - [x] `display: None` to middle of footer
- [x] fav icon to match the ereefs logo
- [ ] menu
  - [ ] menu should show you where you are with highlighting
  - [ ] project website could be renamed to something more clear to someone who is new to our website.
  - [ ] CSIRO -> "CSIRO research portal"
  - [ ] interactive data portal should direct to portal.ereefs.info
  - [ ] visualisation portal menu should not be drop down and should take you to this page.
- [ ] mistaken font [times new roman] on the depth drop down
